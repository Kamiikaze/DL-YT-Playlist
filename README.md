## Overview ##

It's an alternativ youtube playlist downloader. I made this script for fun and I saw that youtube-dl isnt working correctly by importing playlists.

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
This Script will upload all files from playlist in your main-folder. If you delete the track, the track isnt in playlist anymore.


## Requirements ##

You need an YouTube API Key to use this script! You can get your key here >> (https://console.developers.google.com)


## Installation ##

- Download the .zip from this Git
- Extract files to your folder on your webspace
- Edit config.php with your server information and preferences
- Enjoy! =)


## To-Do ##

Coming soon..
